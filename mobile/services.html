            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Helps you connect with Doctors.</span>
            <p>Driven by three core values Ethics, Competence and Compassion, Hospital Guide Foundation's (HGF) current core service is providing healthcare solutions by referring members to Doctors. It is a free service that does not charge its members nor does it have any commercial transaction with suggested healthcare providers/ Doctors, hence ensuring unbiased suggestions. HGF affiliates itself with practitioners after doing a reference check, so that best of advise can be given to patients. Every request is studied and evaluated before suggestions are given. This also involves deciphering the specialty the patient needs to be referred to from the many super specialties that are proliferating.</p>
            <p>When does a patient/attendant send us a request/query</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't know from where to start with your ailment?</li>
                <li>Confused about which super specialist to go to Cardiac Surgeon? Cardiologist?</li>
                <li>Even if you know which kind of super specialist to go to, you will need options for Doctors.</li>
                <li>Even if you know which kind of super specialist to go to, for instance if it is an eye problem you will immediately think of an opthalmologist. But within Opthalmology, Doctors specialize in different ailments of the eye, Cataract, Glaucoma, Ptosis etc.</li>
                <li>Already gone to several Doctors and have not found a solution.</li>
            </ul><br />
            
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Provide a platform/public forum for interaction between Doctors and members via facebook.</span>
            <p>HGF offers a platform for doctors, hospitals, medical fraternity, research scholars, public to share experiences, ideas & opinions. It is our endeavour to ensure that information and education on healthcare is shared for the benefit of all.</p>
            <ul>
