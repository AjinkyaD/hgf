            <p>Hospital Guide Foundation (HGF) is a NGO with a vision to revolutionize health care in India, by bridging gaps to make quality healthcare accessible across all sections of society. It is a free service that does not charge its members nor does it have any commercial transaction with suggested healthcare providers/ Doctors, hence ensuring unbiased suggestions. Driven by three core values Ethics, Competence and Compassion, HGF's current core service is providing healthcare solutions by referring members to Doctors. HGF affiliates itself with practitioners after doing a reference check, so that best of advise can be given to patients. Every request is studied and evaluated before suggestions are given. This also involves deciphering the specialty the patient needs to be referred to from the many super specialties that are proliferating. With overlaps in super specialties sometimes it is even difficult for Doctors to suggest the correct specialty the patient should be referred to. This methodology gives the patient a better chance for the initial diagnosis to be correct and to seek good advise. While the endeavour is to ensure that best healthcare solution is provided, at least two to three opinions in most cases should be taken from across the medical fraternity to ensure that there is a fair chance in getting correct diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. </p>
            <p>It is not only the economically deprived but the rich who also need to know the right Doctor to consult with.The weaker section does not have access to quality healthcare due to financial constraints and HGF will work on devising programs to address that issue. Being a stringent form of a NGO, a Company under section 25 for charitable purposes, gives HGF credibility not only domestically but internationally. This license is granted by the Central Government after a rigorous process and paper work and it involves strict provisions relating to maintenance of accounts and audit. Due to better laws, recognition and administration this form of a NGO has the most reliable organizational structure amongst NGOs in India. This foundation for HGF reinforces its commitment to work towards its vision of providing quality healthcare for all sections of society and a grievance cell where medical negligence is suspected. With the highly complex and continuously evolving health care industry, this is an important social initiative for India. </p>
